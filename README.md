## How it Works

1. Open **Obsidian’s Community Plugins**
2. Search for **Friday** and install
3. Choose a theme from the MDFriday panel
4. Download the theme’s sample notes
5. Right-click a note → **Publish to Web**
6. Click **Preview** to see it live locally

Once previewed, edit the sample notes with your own content —  
and you’ve got your personal site!

You can:
- Export the static site and upload it anywhere
- Or configure cloud settings to **publish directly** with one click
