### 🔒 End-to-End Encryption

Your notes are encrypted before upload. Only your password can decrypt them. Even server administrators cannot view your content.

===

### 📱 Multi-Device Sync

Computer, phone, tablet—as long as Friday is installed, your notes sync in real-time.

===

### ☁️ Local-First

Notes are always stored on your device. The cloud is just a bridge for sync. Even offline, you can work normally.

## How Sync Works

Friday uses the **CouchDB** protocol for synchronization, a mature distributed database technology:

1. **Local Storage**: Notes saved in device's IndexedDB
2. **Change Detection**: Automatically detects file additions, modifications, deletions
3. **Incremental Sync**: Only syncs changed parts, saving bandwidth
4. **Conflict Handling**: Smart handling of simultaneous edits from multiple devices

## Getting Started with Sync

To use sync, you need to:

1. **Get a License Key**
2. **Activate on your first device**
3. **Activate and sync on other devices**

**Important**  
When first activated, an **encryption password** is generated. Make sure to save it! All subsequent devices need this password to decrypt cloud data.
