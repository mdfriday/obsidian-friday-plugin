## Multi-Device Usage Tips

### Sync is Bidirectional

- Changes on Device A sync to Device B
- Changes on Device B sync to Device A
- Sync is real-time (depends on network)

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Wait a few seconds after changes**: Ensure sync completes
2. **Check before switching devices**: Confirm sync icon shows normal
3. **Avoid simultaneous edits on same file**: Though conflicts are handled, best to avoid

### Conflict Handling

If two devices edit the same file simultaneously:

- Friday attempts auto-merge
- If auto-merge fails, both versions are kept
- You can manually choose which to keep

## Common Issues

### Q: Password correct but download fails?

Possible reasons:
1. **Extra spaces when copying**: Re-enter without extra characters
2. **Network issues**: Check connection, retry
3. **Server issues**: Try again later

### Q: Notes incomplete after download?

1. Check if download completed (see progress)
2. Try manual sync: Command palette → "Sync: Pull from Server"
3. Check network and retry

### Q: How many devices can I use?

Depends on your License plan:
- **Free plan**: Up to 2 devices
- **Pro plan**: Up to 5 devices
- **Team plan**: Based on purchased seats

### Q: How to remove a device?

Currently requires contacting support. Self-service management coming soon.
