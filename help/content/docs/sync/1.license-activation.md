## Post-Activation Choices

After activating, the system detects if this is your **first device**:

{{< tabs "activation-choice" >}}
{{% tab "First Device" %}}

If there's no data in the cloud, this is your first device.

The system will:
1. Auto-generate an **encryption password**
2. Show "Upload Local to Cloud" button

**Make sure to save the encryption password!** 

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Second Device" %}}

If there's already data in the cloud, you've activated on another device before.

You need to:
1. Enter the previously saved **encryption password**
2. Click "Download from Cloud"

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Common Issues

### Q: License Key invalid?

Check:
- Is the format correct (`MDF-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`)?
- Any extra spaces?
- Correct letters (note: 0 vs O, 1 vs l)?

### Q: Activation failed?

Possible reasons:
- Network connection issues
- License expired
- Device limit reached

### Q: How to use on a new device?

Each License supports a certain number of devices. Activate with the same License Key on the new device, then enter the encryption password to sync.
