# Encryption Password

The encryption password is the most important security credential in Friday sync. This article explains its purpose and important considerations.

---

## What is the Encryption Password?

The encryption password is a **24-character random string** automatically generated when you first activate your License.

Example format:
```
Ab3Cd5Ef7Gh9Ij1Kl3Mn5Op7
```

## What It Does

### End-to-End Encryption

```
Your Notes → [Encrypt] → Cloud Storage → [Decrypt] → Other Devices
                ↑                              ↑
            Uses Password                 Uses Password
```

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Encrypt | Notes encrypted using your password before upload |
| Storage | Cloud only stores encrypted data |
| Decrypt | Uses password to decrypt when downloading |

### Security Guarantees

- **Server cannot view**: Even if server is breached, attackers cannot read your notes
- **Only you can decrypt**: Password only stored on your devices, never uploaded
- **Strong encryption**: Uses industry-standard encryption algorithms

## Why You Must Save It

{{% hint danger %}}
**Lost Password = Lost Data**

The encryption password is never uploaded to the server or stored in the cloud.  
If you lose the password, **there is no way to recover your cloud data**.

This is the trade-off for end-to-end encryption:

| Traditional Sync | Friday Sync |
|------------------|-------------|
| Provider can reset your password | Only you can access data |
| Provider can see your data | Provider cannot see content |
| Security depends on provider | Security in your control |

## How to Save Securely

### Recommended Methods

{{< tabs "save-password" >}}
{{% tab "Password Manager" %}}

**Most Recommended**

Use 1Password, Bitwarden, KeePass, etc.:

1. Create a new entry named "Friday Encryption Password"
2. Paste password into the password field
3. Save and sync to other devices

Benefits:
- Encrypted storage
- Multi-device access
- Won't be lost

{{% tab "Secure Notes" %}}

**Alternative**

Save in other secure note apps:

1. Use Apple Notes, Google Keep, etc. (with lock feature)
2. Create a locked note
3. Write down the password

Note: Ensure the note itself is encrypted/locked.

{{% tab "Paper Backup" %}}

**Offline Backup**

For extremely important passwords, paper backup is the last resort:

1. Write password clearly on paper
2. Seal in envelope
3. Store securely (safe, locked cabinet, etc.)

Notes:
- Write clearly, avoid confusion (0/O, 1/l)
- Tell someone you trust the location (just in case)

### Not Recommended

❌ Only in phone notes (easily lost with phone)  
❌ Sent to insecure email  
❌ Saved in unencrypted text file  
❌ Relying on memory only

## How to View Current Password

If you've activated but forgot to save:

1. Open **Settings** → **Friday**
2. Find the "Security" area
3. Click **Show Password** button next to "Encryption Password"
4. Copy and save to a secure location

**Note**  
The password is only visible on your device. If you change devices or reinstall Obsidian, you'll need the previously saved password.

## Common Issues

### Q: Can I change the encryption password?

Currently not supported. If you need to change:
1. Export/backup all data locally
2. Recreate sync configuration
3. Re-upload with new password

### Q: What if password is lost?

If the password is truly lost:

1. **Local data is fine**: Notes on current device unaffected
2. **Cloud data irrecoverable**: Encrypted cloud data cannot be decrypted
3. **Start fresh**: Can re-upload local data with new encryption password

### Q: Is the password the same on all devices?

Yes. All devices use **the same encryption password** so they can decrypt each other's data.

### Q: Does the password expire?

No. The encryption password has no expiration date. As long as your License is valid, the password works.

## Security Summary

1. ✅ Save password **immediately** after activation
2. ✅ Use a password manager
3. ✅ Make an offline backup (paper)
4. ✅ Don't store in same place as License Key
5. ❌ Don't share with others (unless you trust them with your notes)
