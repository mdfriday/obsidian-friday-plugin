{{% hint danger %}}
**Extremely Important!**  
After activation, the system auto-generates a **24-character encryption password**.  
This password encrypts all your data. **It cannot be recovered if lost!**
{{% /hint %}}

After activation, in the "Security" area you'll see:

```
Encryption Password: ************************
                    [Show Password] [Copy]
```

**Do this immediately:**

   - Sent to your own email

### Step 3: Upload Local Data to Cloud

1. Find the "Sync" area
2. Click **Upload Local to Cloud** button

## About Encryption

Friday uses **end-to-end encryption**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Encryption Location | Data encrypted before leaving your device |
| Algorithm | Uses strong encryption algorithms |
| Password Storage | Only stored on your device, never uploaded |
| Security | Even if server is breached, data cannot be decrypted |

## Common Issues

### Q: Upload is slow?

First upload transfers all files. Time depends on:
- Your network speed
- Vault size
- Number of images and attachments

Recommend doing first upload with stable network.

### Q: Upload failed?

1. Check network connection
2. Click "Upload Local to Cloud" again
3. If problem persists, try restarting Obsidian

### Q: Forgot to save encryption password?

{{% hint warning %}}
If you haven't closed the settings page, the password is still displayed—save it now!

If already closed without saving:
1. You can still see the encryption password in settings
2. Click "Show Password" to view and save it
